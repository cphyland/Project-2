![Shipwreck](https://github.com/cphyland/Project-2/blob/main/images/shipwreck.jpg)

## Are Ariel and Flounder in danger as they rummage through the shipwreck?


Using Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, & the MongoDB, we intent to visualize shark movement and shipwreck locations to answer the question: Do sharks frequent shipwreck locations?  Use the API data and Leaflet we will produce an interactive map that shows both shark locations including individual data/stats, shipwreck locations including ship data/stats. Users will be able to toggle between shark only, ship only and combined views.

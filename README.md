## Are Ariel and Flounder in danger as they rummage through the shipwreck?


Using Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, textillate.js, bootsrap, d3.js, and leaflet.js we created a map to visualize shark movement and shipwreck locations. Our goal was to answer the question: Do sharks frequent shipwreck locations?  Use the API data and Leaflet we will produce an interactive map that shows both shark locations including individual data/stats, shipwreck locations including ship data/stats. Users will be able to toggle between shark only, ship only and combined views.
